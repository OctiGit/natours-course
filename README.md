# Natours Project

Landing page of a tour-in-nature company.

The language learned in this course's project was CSS and SASS.

This project was built by me, based on the online course The Complete JavaScript Course by professor Jonas Schmedtmann, who designed it and allowed me to use it for my personal learning and portfolio.
